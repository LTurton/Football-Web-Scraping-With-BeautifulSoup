# FootballWebScrapingWithBeautifulSoup
Here I use BeautifulSoup to scrape data of football fixtures from the BBC sport website, from the specified date which is inputted by the user. Returning the result in a neat format in python. Web Scraping carried out using pythons libraries BeautifulSoup and Requests.

The user is asked to input a date in the format (YYYY-MM-DD), as this is what is on the end of the URL for the fixtures for that day from the BBC Sport Website.

```Enter the date that you would like to see fixtures from in the format (YYYY-MM-DD): 2022-01-27```

This will then display the fixtures for that chosen date:

Requesting for a date in the future:

```Enter the date that you would like to see fixtures from in the format (YYYY-MM-DD): 2022-02-02```
